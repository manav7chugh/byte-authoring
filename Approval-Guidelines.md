## Acknowledgement

Rumie is a learning technology nonprofit organization, located in Toronto, Canada, that facilitates the authoring and free dissemination of microlearning courses called Bytes. Rumie provides the tools and a platform for volunteers to build Bytes covering a broad range of topics, based on their skills and expertise. We acknowledge the inherent cultural, linguistic, and geographic biases present in our own organization and core author community. As a small organization, we try our best to guide contributions that are culturally sensitive and aware.

## Standards

Rumie will not post authored content that:

1. may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal;
2. may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property;
3. seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise;
4. may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort;
5. contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libellous, threatening, profane, obscene, or otherwise objectionable;
6. contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party's trade secrets);
7. contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships; or
8. contains any information or content that you know is not correct and current.
9. may not publish or post other people's private information (such as home phone number and address) without their express authorization and permission.
10. may not violate others' intellectual property rights, including copyright and trademark.

## Proofing

Before publishing any Bytes publicly, Rumie reviews Bytes for the following elements:

* Correct spelling and grammar
* Appropriate formatting
* Sufficient attribution (facts and external imagery are accompanied by a source as needed)
* Appropriate categorization under related category/topic/theme
* Appropriate timing selection (3/6/9 min)

## Tagging

Tags are small keywords that you attach to your Byte. Tags act like labels to tell users what the content is about.

If Rumie-Learn is like a gigantic book, tags are what make up the **index**. They let learners browse and find the content that is most relevant to them, without reading everything cover to cover. 

### Tags vs. Categories

If tags are like the index, categories are like the chapters listed in the table of contents at the start. They're the big buckets that Rumie-Learn is made of.

In general, categories are longer than tags (a few words rather than just one or two keywords) and you'll have fewer of them.

* Tags are short and specific, typically 1-2 words.
* Categories tend to be longer and more general.
* Your categories are like your table of contents, and your tags are like your index.
* Categories are hierarchical and required. Tags are not.

### Tagging Areas

#### UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

Byte content relates or contributes to one/more SDGs:

* sdg1nopoverty
* sdg2zerohunger
* Sdg3goodhealth
* sdg4qualityeducation
* sdg5genderequality
* Sdg6cleanwater
* sdg7cleanenergy
* sdg8decentwork
* sdg9industry
* sdg10reducedinequality
* sdg11sustainablecities
* sdg12responsibleconsumption
* Sdg13climateaction
* sdg14lifebelowwater
* Sdg15lifeonland
* sdg16peaceandjustice
* Sdg17partnership<br>

#### Geotagging

Content is only relevant or appropriate in certain regions. E.g., northamerica, Afghanistan, USA, Canada, Toronto, new york city, Barcelona etc. 

#### Learner Intent

Is the learner uncovering a problem or a solution?

* **problem aware: the learner is seeking to understand a challenge or its causes*

E.g.,[<u>Identifying Bullying in Different Settings</u>](https://learn.rumie.org/jR/bytes/identifying-bullying-in-different-settings/view)

* **solution aware: the learner is exploring possible solutions to address the challenge*

E.g., [<u>Responding to Bullying</u>](https://learn.rumie.org/jR/bytes/responding-to-bullying/view)

#### Trends

Focus on trends and fluid topics. Trends are topical (may be highly relevant now, and less relevant in 12 months) in contrast to categories (which are likely to be equally relevant today and in 12 months).

Examples might include: 

* covid19
* remote work
* election
* virtual reality
* fake news
* influencer
