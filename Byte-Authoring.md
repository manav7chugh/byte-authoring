## About Bytes

* Bytes are **microlearning experiences**, less than 10 minutes long
* Each Byte has one learning objective
* Bytes focus on **applying the concept** in a real-world context

## Content Guidelines

We create Bytes primarily on soft life and career skills that orient on the action. **Soft skills** are non-technical abilities that relate to how we work and interact with others. _For example: teamwork, communication, and adaptability._

## Learning Objectives (LOs)

_Training Session_[<u>recording</u>]() ,[<u>deck</u>](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WcLQcp_Y0sc4J20KfFBYbePwLSNWM3O5NIMgsmmJoJQ/edit?usp=sharing) , and [<u>activity</u>]().

### LO Purpose

* LOs help _learners_ self identify appropriate content. It helps answer the question: will this be helpful to me? Is this the outcome I'm looking for?
* LOs help _Byte authors_ maintain focus, ensuring that all content is directly contributing to or 'laddering up' to the learning objective.

### LOs vs SMART Goals

LOs and SMART Goals both:

* Take a specific, narrow focus
* Are attainable within the learner's context
* Have an unambiguous timeline
* Can be measured

But, in contrast to SMART Goals, Byte LOs:

* Have only short term goals (what is attainable in 10 minutes or less?)
* Must only be measurable in theory (because we are not there to assess learner performance in person)

### Authoring Effective LOs

1. Confirm: _does it align with Rumie's_ [<u>content guidelines</u>](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S9ceZKlI7ODSk-SCnVW022ErcSoJWgUdwVGrKNhjWSo/edit#heading=h.rq3dbcz1umxk) _?_
2. _Confirm: does it add something new to the Byte library?_

* There will be Bytes that cover similar content or overlap in some ways, and that's okay. But, we don't need to create Bytes that repeat what already exists.
* Check the existing Byte library on Rumie-Learn and objectives in ClickUp to confirm your idea is not duplicative.
* Your objective should add something unique or complement existing Bytes.

1. _Start the sentence with a Bloom's Taxonomy verb._

* If possible, aim for the "application" level.
* This anchors the content on an _observable action_ and avoids being just an information dump.

1. _Ensure it's Byte sized._

* Because Bytes are short learning bursts, we'll often break down a learning objective into multiple, smaller chunks.
* While it's possible to deliver a Byte that has a high-level overview of a complex topic, it won't allow you to go in detail with specific elements. <br>
_Example In Action_

_There is one Byte that overviews "SMART Goals," and also 5 individual Bytes that go into each of the letters in greater detail._

* Use a mind map to breakdown your objective into sub-components. If you can create three or more layers of branching, choose one of the lower branches to create an attainable and appropriately sized objective.

1. _Keep the language simple._

* Just like the content in Bytes themselves, we want to learn objectives to be clear and direct. Ask yourself: Would an 8th grader understand it?

## Learning Strategies

### Hook the Learner

* Use the Background Info section to pull learners in and pique their interest.
* Ask a provocative question, use a scenario, or share an impactful statistic.

_Example In Action_

Sample Learning Objective: Contrast customer- and competitor-centric organizations. 

* "What do Netflix, Amazon, and Uber have in common?They disrupted their industries by being customer-centric, instead of competitor-centric.<br>
By focusing on customer needs, they were able to highlight their competitors' shortfalls and gain market share.
  * Netflix didn't kill Blockbuster, the late fees did.
  * Amazon didn't kill some retailers, poor customer service did.
  * Uber didn't kill the taxi industry, limited access and fare control did."<br>

### Examples, examples, examples!

* Bytes are about tangible application, not theory.
* If you share an idea or concept, back it up with how it actually plays out in real life.
* Use multiple examples, include them as content steps, add them as multiple choice questions, make them into scenarios.

_Example In Action_

Sample Learning Objective: Track financial expenses.

* Define 'expenses,' then give examples like: the money you spend on rent, food, and clothing.

Sample Learning Objective: Use creative outlets to relieve stress.

* Define 'creative outlets' then give some examples like: drawing, writing, or cooking.

### Audio Clips

* Custom audio is a great way to demonstrate the specific concept you're teaching. It's a lot easier than hunting for an ultra-specific video on Youtube that may not exist.
* For maximum impact, pair audio with a multiple-choice question that prompts the learner to apply their learning.

_Example In Action_

Sample Learning Objective: deliver feedback constructively.

* Use text to introduce a scenario, like a boss giving feedback to an employee during a private meeting. Record an audio clip of the boss giving feedback imperfectly. Use a multiple-choice question to ask what opportunity the boss had to improve their feedback delivery.
* Use text to introduce a scenario of an individual who wants to give feedback to their coworker. Record two audio clips for how they could deliver the feedback. Use a multiple-choice question to ask which option would be a more constructive way to deliver feedback.

### Multiple Choice Questions

* The best multiple-choice questions nudge learners to make an active decision and apply their learning, not just recall information. 
  - One way to do this is to present a brief scenario or example that has not already been shared. In the example, have the learner identify the next course of action, or how a situation could be handled better, etc.
* Try to make answers a similar length (otherwise, learners will usually guess the longest one)
* Try to make distractor answers plausible. Answers that obviously wrong make the question too easy. We want to make all options somewhat tempting.

_Example In Action_
Sample Learning Objective: Differentiate between fixed and variable expenses.
* After introducing the concept (likely with some examples), ask "Which of these is a variable expense?" Ensure all the responses are _new_ examples (i.e. not referenced immediately above).

_Example In Action_
Sample Learning Objective: Introduce yourself at a networking event.
* Introduce a scenario using text. E.g., the learner is at a networking event and has spotted someone they want to speak to. Ask "What would be a good icebreaker to say to this individual?" Make the variations of the response of what someone could say, demonstrating the points you've taught in the Byte, but _not_ explicitly replicating the above examples.

### Strong Takeaway Prompts

In the final "summary" step of your Byte, give the learner a prompt for something action-oriented they can do to apply their learning. This gives them the opportunity to extend their learning. You can think of it almost like you're assigning some light homework.

_Example In Action_
Sample Learning Objective: Take a collaborative approach to brainstorming.
* "This week, the next time you're faced with a problem, take the opportunity to brainstorm with your team. Set aside 30 minutes to sit together and...."
Sample Learning Objective: Create a visually attractive resume.
* "Over the next few days, look online to find at least 3 examples of resumes that look clean and professional. Use these samples as models to begin building your own polished resume."

## Writing Style

Terminology

* Write directly to our learners, it makes the tone warm and friendly. Use terms like "you," "our," and "we."
* When referring to a generic person whose gender is unknown or irrelevant to the context, use the singular "they" instead of "he/she."
* Try to keep your examples as **location agnostic** as possible. Choose examples and terminology with wide applicability.<br>
For example:
  - Say 'market' instead of 'grocery store'
  - Reference a 'coworker' but don't make a scenario explicitly in an office environment
  - Be cautious of mentioning something that might be culturally taboo (i.e. protesting, adultery, etc.)

### Simplify Writing

_Training Session_ [<u>recording</u>]() _,_ [<u>deck</u>]() _, and_ [<u>activity</u>]() _._

* To write simply, keep in mind the guiding principle: **first brevity, then clarity.** This means starting with the bare bones and adding supporting details/qualifying words to ensure your message is clear.
* Cut the jargon and use straight forward vocabulary. Re-read your Byte out loud to delete unnecessary words where possible.<br>
_Examples in Action:_
  - Say "is part of" instead of "contributes to"
  - Say "uses" instead of "utilizes"
  - Say "makes" instead of "generates"
* Choose to write in bullet points over paragraphs. Any 'x, y, and z,' list can easily become a bulleted list.
* Use an active voice. This means putting the subject (actor) at the beginning of the sentence. Or use the imperative if the subject would be "you."

_Example in Action:_ <br>
Don't say: "Follow-up emails are sent by successful candidates." <br>
Say: "Successful candidates send follow-up emails." <br>
Say: "Send a follow-up email." <br>
* Use shorter sentences. Instead of using multiple commas, semicolons, or dashes, break one sentence into separate chunks. Connecting words like _however, therefore, additionally, moreover,_ are also clues to break up your sentence.
* Use affirmative language. This means pointing out what people _should_do instead of negations.

_Example in Action:_ <br>
Don't say: "Don't leave your shoes on when you enter the house." <br>
Say: "Take your shoes off when you enter the house." <br>

## Peer Review

_Consider these points as you complete a peer review of a Byte._

| | |
| ---- | ---- | 
| **Learning Effectiveness** | * Does the Byte fulfill the stated objective? <br> * Is the content ordered in a logical way? (I.e. big picture before supporting details?) |
| **Writing** | * Is the language simple and approachable? (Can I remove any jargon?) <br> * Is the language action-oriented (i.e. "Do this" vs. "One would do this")? <br> * Is the writing concise and direct (is there any filler that can be removed without compromising the message?) <br> * Does the writing flow well from one point to the next? (Do transitions smoothly connect the points?)<br> |
| **Format** | * Does the formatting look clean and consistent? <br> * Does the imagery complement the writing? <br> * Is this learning experience shorter than 10 minutes? _(i.e. When I read it through to digest the information, watch all media, and engage with questions, the total seat time should be ~10 minutes or less. **Consider your reading speed in this assessment. If you're a slow reader, allow yourself ~15 minutes per Byte. If you're a fast reader, allow yourself ~5 minutes per Byte.**)_ |
| **Engagement** | * Is there at least one multiple-choice question?  <br>  * Does it require the learner to apply their learning? (vs. simple recall/memorization) <br> * Is there at least one instance of audio or video? |
